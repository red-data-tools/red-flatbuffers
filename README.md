# Red FlatBuffers

Red FlatBuffers is a pure Ruby FlatBuffers implementation.

Red FlatBuffers can generate Ruby code that reads/writes FlatBuffers from `.fbfs` (binary FlatBuffers schema). Red FlatBuffers can't compile `.fbs` (FlatBuffers schema) to `.fbfs`. You need to use FlatBuffers to compile `.fbs` to `.fbfs`.

## Install

```bash
gem install red-flatbuffers
```
